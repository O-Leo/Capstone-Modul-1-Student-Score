Business Task
Key Feature

•  Add Data (Students, Lectures, and Courses)

•	Manipulate Student Data (Name, Code, Scores, and Rank)

•	Manipulate Lecture Data (Name, Code)

•	Manipulate Courses Name

•	Display Student Data (Name, Code, Scores, Courses, and Rank)

•	Display Lecture Data (Name, Code)

•	Display Courses List

•	Display Ranking

•	Provide shorting system based on student rank

Objectives

•	Provide solution to manage student/lecture/course data

•	Assist users to review their academic achievement

•	As one of the bootcamp assignment project

Stakeholder

•	End Users : Students and lectures for managing their academic data

•	Developers : Development team for developing and researching the program

•	Academic : Academic institute for researching and utilizing program for managing the academic data

Limitations
This projects has several limitations to consider :

•	Dummy Data : The program only use small dummy data for study purposes

•	No Automatic Score Update : Score for new course need to be manually input by user

•	No Automatic Lecture Code Update : User need to assign manually, data student to their lecture code

•	Ranking Limitation : Ranking only be done based on the same lecture code not overall student data

This data will be used to create a small university database that users can search. Ensure this data is prepared before running the program.
